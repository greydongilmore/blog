Welcome! This blog is an accumulation of my past/present experiences during my graduate school career. I wanted a place to accumulate tips and ideas that I have found useful during my time as a grad student.

I hope you find some useful material here, feel free to <a href='https://www.greydongilmore.com/#contact' target="_blank">contact me</a>.

The content is split into two streams:

1. [PhD related](phd_related/index.html): things I have found helpful during my PhD (i.e. software, processes etc.)
2. Operating system tips: advice on installation of various software for different operating systems
    * [Ubuntu 18.04/20.04](operating_systems/linux/index.html)
    * [Windows 10 subsystem for linux](operating_systems/wsl/index.html)
    * [Windows 10](operating_systems/windows/index.html)
